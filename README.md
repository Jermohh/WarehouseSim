# WarehouseSim

A multiplayer warehouse-management simulation built in **Unreal Engine 5** with C++.

## 🎮 Overview
WarehouseSim is a small Unreal Engine project that explores inventory and logistics gameplay:
- Run a warehouse solo or with friends.
- Unload trucks, scan and sort boxes, place them on conveyor belts, and reload trucks once they’re sorted.
- Buy and upgrade pallets, scanners, and conveyor belts.
- Save/load progress so upgrades persist.
